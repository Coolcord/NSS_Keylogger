NSS Keylogger
=============

A "Not-So-Subtle" Keylogger that logs key presses and mouse clicks

-==========================- About NSS Keylogger -==========================-

NSS Keylogger stands for the "Not-So-Subtle" Keylogger. It is based off of
Clicktastic v1.0.1. The goal of this project was to show how simple it can be
to create a keylogger once a low level keyboard or mouse hook is provided.

First, I should probably explain what a keylogger does in case you don't know.
A keylogger logs every key press or potentially every mouse click that a user
performs. This poses a massive security risk, as it renders passwords utterly
useless, logging exactly what the user types.

As hard as it may be to believe, this is an EDUCATIONAL project. I am a man of
science, and I wish to learn as much as possible in my lifetime. Consequently,
I do not intend to use this application to cause harm to others. Considering
that it is based off of Clicktastic, which was released under GPL, it only
makes sense to stick to the license and release this under GPL as well.
I'm sure there are others out there that are curious how keyloggers work, and
they are completely open to studying and using this code, so long as they obey
the GPL license.

HOWEVER, I DO NOT CONDONE BLACK-HAT USE OF THIS APPLICATION!!! IF YOU GET IN
TROUBLE FOR USING THIS APPLICATION, OR SOMEONE STEALS INFORMATION FROM YOU
WITH THIS APPLICATION, I CANNOT BE HELD RESPONSIBLE!!!

It is for these reasons that I made this application "Not-So-Subtle." Network
support is limited to what Windows explorer supports. Consequently, there is
no packet "piggybacking" or anything of the like. Advanced keyloggers tend
to make use of such features. With all of this in mind, the main focus of this
project is aimed more towards the low level keyboard and mouse hooks and
how dangerous they can be if they are misused.

Finally, it is important to note that "Subtle Mode" only hides the window.
The process can still be seen using the task manager.
